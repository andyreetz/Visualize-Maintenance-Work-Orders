## Problem
A lack of useful metrics for maintenance work orders meant it was impossible to see trends or get a perspective of the bigger picture. There was also no way to see a live view of where critical machinery was down.

## Solution
Using Microsoftâ€™s Power BI, created a data source to the maintenance work order server and a live report. The report was published via the Power BI app so that users would have up-to-date information. Work order volume was color coded onto a map of the facility, with the ability to drill through to more detailed information about time series trends, department details, and recurring issues by machine.
